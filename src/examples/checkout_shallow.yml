  git shallow clone instead of checkout.
  You can change depth and fetch_depth, but I do recommend set fetch_depth lager than 1.
  If you set fetch_depth 1, you will find build failed when new commit was pushed.
  fetch_depth default is 10 to cover re-build after several commit.
  Default github.com and bitbucket.org ssh key will not scan.
  # set fetch_depth: 1 to minimize fetch time
  - git/checkout_shallow:
      fetch_depth: 1
  # change depth:5 for some reason.
  - git/checkout_shallow:
      depth: 5
      fetch_depth: 5
  # enable github ssh key scan
  - git/checkout_shallow:
      keyscan_github: true
  # enable bitbucket ssh key scan
  - git/checkout_shallow:
      keyscan_bitbucket: true
